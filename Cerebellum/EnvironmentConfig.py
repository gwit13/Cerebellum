"""
EnvironmentConfig.py
This file contains the EnvironmentConfig class, which is used to specify
the control structure of a given test stand - IP addresses, interface types,
etc. Ideally, the environment configuration is determined once and will not
change between test cycles. Configurations can be stored in JSON files for
later use. Primarily used by EnvironmentControl.

Definitions
    - Outgoing Dependency: "This power supply must see a voltage of at least _
    coming from PSU X before it will activate." For example, the HVPS will
    always check if the LVPS is operating before it will activate.
    - Incoming Dependency: "This power supply cannot deactivate until X is
    deactivated." Likewise, the LVPS must see that the HVPS is disabled before
    it will turn off.

This file also contains the PSUConfig class, which is a helper class used
to specify the control configuration of a power supply in the test environment.
